# Kitchen Ingredients App

This project is a React application designed to help users manage their kitchen ingredients and receive meal recommendations based on what they have available. The app categorizes ingredients by their storage location (fridge, cupboard, etc.) and suggests meals that can be prepared with the available items.

## Features

- **Ingredient Management**: Users can view and manage their ingredients categorized by storage location.
- **Meal Recommendations**: The app suggests meals based on the ingredients currently available in the pantry.
- **Dynamic Updates**: The ingredient list updates dynamically as users add or remove items.
